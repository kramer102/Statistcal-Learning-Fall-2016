##Linear Regression
I'm making up some data based around a Bayseian Estimation example kinda 
I'm going to think of using regression to try to understand the speed of sound from fake measurements.<p>kasljdfh</p>

Read the wikipedia on the speed of sound and it's way more interesting than I thought, but I think I'm going to start with generating data from the equation $c_{ ideal }\quad =\quad \sqrt { \frac { \gamma \cdot R\cdot T }{ \rho  }  } ,\quad R\~ 8.3144598(48)\cdot J\cdot mol^{ -1 }\cdot K^{ -1 }$

So I'm defining a linear regression that will give me the P(speed|gamma,R,T) from data I make up based on the formula
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
# calorically perfect air
# ratio of specific heat
# R = gas constant (286 m^2/s^2/K for air)
gam_p <- 1.4
R <- 286 
n <- 100

# adding some noise
epsilon = rnorm(n,0,10)

# I want data of y = speed of sound from 273k to 373k degrees
T <- c(seq(273,373,by = .5))
# I thought of this as an error in T, but I think the error will propagate
# the actual error is sqrt(gamma*R*epsilon)
sigma <- sqrt(gam_p*10) # maybe
T_error <- T + epsilon 
T_inC <- T-273
a_sq_real = R*T*gam_p
y_real = sqrt(a_sq_real)
a_sq = R*T_error*gam_p

# I want data of y = speed of sound from 273k to 373k degrees
y = sqrt(a_sq)

D = data.frame(Temp = T_inC, Measured.Speed = y)
plot(D)

# r linear model
lm = lm(D$Measured.Speed ~ D$Temp)
abline(lm)

# the actual slope is gamma*R
slp <- sqrt(gam_p*R) # wrong- it's squared - no actual slope --use derivative

# calculated
inter <- lm$coefficients[2]

```

Okay, so I want to model the P(speed|Temp C) for any given Speed... 
Is this like P(330|20°) = like 80%
So... I guess it's N(y|Ax+B,∑)

```{r,}



Py_x = pnorm(D$Measured.Speed, D$Temp*lm$coefficients[2]+lm$coefficients[1],sigma)
qplot(D$Temp,Py_x, geom = "point") # doesn't really seem to work

A = lm$coefficients[2]
B = lm$coefficients[1]
sigma = 10
P_330_0 <-09

get_Py_x <- function(speed,temp){
  ## Okay - this gives the probability of x>X or x<X depending on the lower.tail setting. It's not really the prob of being correct. the prob of a point is 0
  P <- pnorm(speed, temp*lm$coefficients[2]+lm$coefficients[1],sigma,lower.tail = FALSE)
  return(P)
}

```
